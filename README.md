# TrashPanda
A Repository for an ML based solution to Trash Truck routing for real world applications. A Custom model defined on Tensorflow for accurate prediction of Trash Truck's routing for a city, depending on parameters of how fast the trashcans at each street fill up and traffic, such that the operating costs for the company is minimal.

The software is built to be ready to deploy with API endpoints built using FastAPI and telemetry implemented using PostgreSQL.

The repository also contains some sample input data for testing the system

# Core requirements

- Python 3.10.x (otherwise Tensorflow will break)
- Tensorflow 2.12
- FastAPI
